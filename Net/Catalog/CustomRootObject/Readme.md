## Custom Root Object (Style Gallery)

The GxStyles sample demonstrates how to create custom GxObjects and a custom GxView. It introduces a new root node (called Style Gallery) that when expanded, contains a tree structure of styles. Individual styles can be previewed with a new custom view that is available under the Preview tab.
