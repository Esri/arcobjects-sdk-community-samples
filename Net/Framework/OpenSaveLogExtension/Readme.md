## Extension to listen to document open and save events

A component can listen to events fired by the application when a document is created, opened, or closed. However, no event is fired when a document is saved. ToÂ log the time when a document is saved, create a custom extension that implements persistence. This sample shows how to implement an application extension that logs user and date time information when a document is opened or saved.
