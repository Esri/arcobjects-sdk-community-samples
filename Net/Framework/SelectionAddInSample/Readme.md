## Custom selection extension

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:my="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/infopath/2003/myXSD/2006-02-10T23:25:53">This sample demonstrates how to create a complete add-in. The sample is based around a selection theme but its purpose is to demonstrate multiple add-in components working together. This add-in contains an extension, a dockview, a toolbar with several buttons and tools, and a menu. All components are disabled until the extension is selected on the Extensions dialog box. The extension does not load until it needs to (it delay loads). Similarly, the dockview only gets created once the Toggle DockView button is clicked. </div>
