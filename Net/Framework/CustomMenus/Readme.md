## Add a custom menu created in .NET to ArcGIS Desktop

This sample demonstrates how to create a base or root-level menu with submenu functionality. The root-level menu is created by inheriting the BaseMenu class from the ESRI.ArcGIS.ADF.Local assembly's ESRI.ArcGIS.ADF namespace and by implementing the [ESRI.ArcGIS.Framework.IRootLevelMenu](http://esriFramework/IRootLevelMenu.htm) interface. The submenu functionality is created by using existing ArcGIS functionality that is accessed by the class identifier (CLSID) and ProgID in ArcMap. Additionally, a custom command is created and is accessed as a submenu. This sample contains all of the code demonstrated in the [Adding a custom menu created in .NET to ArcGIS Desktop](http://e685b331-303d-47a0-ae4f-22a41ab3566b) walkthrough.
