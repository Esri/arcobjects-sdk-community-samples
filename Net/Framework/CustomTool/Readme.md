## Create a custom tool

This sample demonstrates how to create a tool. Tools are commands that enable the user to interact with map and page layout documents. The tool is created by inheriting the BaseTool class from ESRI.ArcGIS.ADF.Local. This sample contains the code demonstrated in the walkthrough, [Create a custom tool](http://ec9c3bf9-1bae-4d56-9ae6-e439dbd0f18f).
