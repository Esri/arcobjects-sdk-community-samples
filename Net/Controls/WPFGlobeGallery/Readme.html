  ## WPF Globe Gallery

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This sample shows how to host the ArcGIS Engine Globe .NET control with the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) classes. It displays various exported thumbnails from globe (.3dd) documents and takes advantage of WPF features such as image translation. All of the WPF elements are defined in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) includingÂ various templates and styles. The sample also shows how to do the following:</div>

*   Handle license initialization
*   Create and host the control with a WindowsFormsHost
*   Format control styles with XAML
*   Handle WPF and Globe control events
*   Wire up existing tools to WPF controls
*   Release Component Object Model (COM) objects
