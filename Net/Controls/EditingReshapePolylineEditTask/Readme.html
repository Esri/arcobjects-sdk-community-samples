  ## Custom reshape polyline edit task

This sample illustrates how to create a custom ArcGIS Engine edit task that can be used in conjunction with the out-of-the-box editing commands. The Reshape Polyline edit task allows the user to perform a reshape on the selected feature within an edit session.

### Usage
1. Build and run the sample.  
1. Start editing.  
1. Zoom in on a polyline feature that you want to reshape.  
1. Select this feature with the Edit tool.  
1. Select the Reshape Polyline edit task from the Edit Task Tool control.  
1. Using the Sketch tool, digitize a new line that intersects the selected feature in at least two places.  
1. Finish the sketch to perform the reshape.  
1. Stop editing and save edits to persist changes. See the following illustration:

Compiling this sample registers the edit task in the ESRI Engine Edit Tasks component category, which is used to populate the ControlsEditingTaskToolControl at runtime. The position of the task within the ControlsEditingTaskToolControl list is controlled using the IEngineEditTask.GroupName property and the display name using the IEngineEditTask.Name property. The IEngineEditTask.Activate method is called when the end user selects the edit task in the ControlsEditingTaskToolControl. The Activate method is used to set up listeners to the following IEngineEditEvents:</div>

The IEngineEditTask.OnFinishSketch method is used to reshape the geometry of the selected feature using the IPolyline.Reshape method, passing in a path created from the digitized sketch as an argument. The task calls the IFeature.Store method within an edit operation to commit the changes.</div>
