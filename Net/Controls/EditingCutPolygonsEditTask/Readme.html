  ## Cut polygons without selection edit task

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:my="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/infopath/2003/myXSD/2006-02-10T23:25:53">This sample illustrates how to create a custom ArcGIS Engine edit task that can be used in conjunction with the out-of-the-box editing commands. The Cut Polygons Without Selection edit task allows the user to cut features in a polygon layer using the Sketch tool without requiring a selection.</div>

1. Build and run the sample.   
1. Start editing.  
1. Zoom in polygon features to cut.  
1. Click the Cut Polygons Without Selection task.  
1. Click the Sketch tool.  
1. Cut a polygon (or polygons) in two or more places with the Sketch tool.  
1. Finish the sketch to perform the cut.

Compiling this sample registers the edit task in the ESRI Engine Edit Tasks component category which is used to populate the ControlsEditingTaskToolControl at runtime.  </div>

Edits to features are made in a single edit operation and added to the operation stack.  </div>
