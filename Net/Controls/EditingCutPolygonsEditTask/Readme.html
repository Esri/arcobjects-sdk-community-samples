  ## Cut polygons without selection edit task

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:my="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/infopath/2003/myXSD/2006-02-10T23:25:53">This sample illustrates how to create a custom ArcGIS Engine edit task that can be used in conjunction with the out-of-the-box editing commands. The Cut Polygons Without Selection edit task allows the user to cut features in a polygon layer using the Sketch tool without requiring a selection.</div>

1. Build and run the sample.   
1. Start editing.  
1. Zoom in polygon features to cut.  
1. Click the Cut Polygons Without Selection task.  
1. Click the Sketch tool.  
1. Cut a polygon (or polygons) in two or more places with the Sketch tool.  
1. Finish the sketch to perform the cut.  
1. Stop editing. See the following illustration:

Compiling this sample registers the edit task in the ESRI Engine Edit Tasks component category which is used to populate the ControlsEditingTaskToolControl at runtime.  </div>

Edits to features are made in a single edit operation and added to the operation stack.  </div>
