##Save a layer file in a MapControl application

###Purpose  
This sample demonstrates how to create and save a layer file in a stand-alone ArcGIS Engine application. In addition to providing the ability to save layer files, this sample also implements a context menu that opens when you right-click a layer in the application's table of contents (TOC). This context menu hosts two commands: Save the current layer as a layer file and Remove the current layer from the map.   


###Usage
1. Start Visual Studio, open the solution file, and build the project.  
1. Press F5 to run the MapControl application.  
1. Use the AddData command to add a dataset to the map, or as an alternative, use Add MapDocument to add an existing map document to the map.  
1. Right-click a layer in the TOC to open the context menu.  
1. Click the Create Layer File command to save the current layer with its current renderer as a layer file.  
1. Use the Load Layer File command to load the new layer to the map.
