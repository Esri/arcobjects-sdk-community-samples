## Save a layer file in a MapControl application

This sample demonstrates how to create and save a layer file in a stand-alone ArcGIS Engine application. In addition to providing the ability to save layer files, this sample also implements a context menu that opens when you right-click a layer in the application's table of contents (TOC). This context menu hosts two commands: Save the current layer as a layer file and Remove the current layer from the map.
