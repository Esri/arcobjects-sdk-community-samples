### Usage
1. Open the solution and set EngineApplication as the startup project.  
1. Build the solution and run the application.  
1. Add point, polyline, and/or polygon feature class data to the map.  
1. Select a feature layer and use the Attach/Detach Tabbed Inspector Extension command.  
1. Confirm that the status bar at the bottom of the EngineApplication displays the Tabbed Inspector Extension as successfully attached to the selected feature class.  
1. Start editing, then choose one or more features from the selected feature class and open the Attribute dialog box.  
1. Ensure that a feature is selected in the Attribute dialog box tree. The Custom tab of the Attribute dialog box shows the output from the custom object inspector.

The Tabbed Feature Inspector is attached to a feature class using the feature class's IClassSchemaEdit interface.
