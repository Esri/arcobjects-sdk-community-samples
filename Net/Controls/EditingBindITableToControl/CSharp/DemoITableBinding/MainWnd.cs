  /// The form this class defines contains a DataGridView, a TextBox and a 
  /// BindingNavigator. The class will load the test data and bind it to both
  /// the TextBox and the DataGridView by using a BindingSource. The use of a
  /// BindingSource allows us to bind the test data to a single object that will
  /// act as a datasource for the grid, the text box and the navigation control.
  /// This allows changes made in one control to be reflected in the other controls
  /// with minimal coding effort. This is most clearly demonstrated by using the
  /// navigation control to step backwards and forwards through the grid rows
  /// while also showing the value of a single field in the current row in the
  /// text box.
