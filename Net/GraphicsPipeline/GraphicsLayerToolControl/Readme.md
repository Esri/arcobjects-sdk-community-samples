## Graphics layers ToolControl

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:my="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/infopath/2003/myXSD/2006-02-10T23:25:53">This sample demonstrates creating a ToolControl by implementing the IToolControl interface. The ToolControl hosts a drop-down list that displays the names of the graphics layers in the map. The end user can select and activate a graphics layer from the ToolControl. This sample also includes a command that creates and adds a new graphics layer to a map. A ToolbarDef hosts both the ToolControl and the new graphics layer command. The following techniques are covered by this sample:</div>

*   Implementing IToolControl
*   Wiring IActiveViewEvents
*   Creating graphics layer
*   Getting and setting the active graphics layer
*   Implementing IToolbarDef
