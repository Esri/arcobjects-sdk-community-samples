1. Open the Customize dialog box. On the Commands tab, select the Add-In Controls. The Add-In Controls appear, including the Set Time Extents button.   
1. Drag the Set Time Extents button onto one of the toolbars and close the Customize dialog box.  
1. Double-click atlantic_hurricanes_2000 to open the layer's properties.
