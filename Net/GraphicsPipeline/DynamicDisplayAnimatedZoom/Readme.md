### Usage
1. Start Visual Studio and open the solution.

1. Add the Animated Zoom In and Animated Zoom Out tools to the ToolbarControl (located in the .NET samples category).  
1. Run the application.  
1. Click the Add Data command, select the Rasters data type on the dialog box, browse to <your ArcGIS developer kit install location>\Samples\data\wsiearth, then choose the wsiearth.tif file.  
1. Click Open to add the .tif file to the map.  
1. Make sure the map is in dynamic mode (see Additional Requirements in this sample for details if not using the MyDynamicDisplayApp sample).  
1. Click the Animated Zoom In tool, then click and drag an envelope on to the map.  
1. Click the Animated Zoom Out tool, then click and drag an envelope on to the map.  
1. Turn off the dynamic map and close the application.
