### Usage
1. Start Visual Studio and open the solution.  
1. Build the solution to make the DynamicLogo library. Use this command in an application with a MapControl and a ToolbarControl, such as in the MapControl Application template provided in the Visual Studio Integration.  
1. Add the command to the ToolbarControl. The command (Show Logo) is located in the .NET Samples category.  
1. Run the application and add any layer to use as a background.  
1. Click the Show Logo command and add the logo to the map. A logo is added in the lower-left corner of the map. When you switch the map into dynamic mode, the logo remains in place.
