### Usage
#### Building the component  
1. Start Visual Studio, open the solution file, and build the project.  

#### Copying the sample database in a working folder  
1. Navigate to <ArcGIS DeveloperKit install location>\Samples\data\Schematics  
1. Copy the ExtendedCriteriaSamples.gdb geodatabase in a folder for which you have full rights.  

#### Configuring a Node Reduction By Priority rule using the Reduce if connected cable diameters are 8 custom reduce extended criteria  
1. Start ArcCatalog, browse to the copied ExtendedCriteriaSamples geodatabase, right-click the ExtendedCriteriaSamples_Schematic schematic dataset, then click Edit.  
1. From the Schematic Dataset Editor tree, click the DiagramsFromSampleFeatureDataset diagram template.  
1. Click the Rules tab.  
1. If there are rule items on the Rules tab, uncheck their related Active box.  
1. Click Add Rule on the Rules tab toolbar.  
1. Select Node Reduction By Priority from the Type drop-down list .  
1. Click Rule Properties on the Rules tab toolbar. The Node Reduction By Priority rule properties page displays.
