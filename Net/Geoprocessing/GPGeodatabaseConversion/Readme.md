## Using list functions to migrate from personal geodatabases to file geodatabases

A common conversion task is the large-scale transfer of data from one format to another. This sample takes advantage of ListWorkspaces, ListFeatureClasses, ListTables, and ListDatasets to identify the personal geodatabases in a folder and converts the feature datasets, feature classes, and tables of each to file geodatabases.
