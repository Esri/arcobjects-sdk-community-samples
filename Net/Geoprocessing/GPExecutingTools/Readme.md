## Executing geoprocessing tools

This sample uses the Geoprocessor class in conjunction with geoprocessing tool classes to execute a series of geoprocessing tools. This sample shows how to extract features to a new feature class based on a location and an attribute query. This sample illustrates how to execute geoprocessing tools and set geoprocessing environments in a .NET application.
