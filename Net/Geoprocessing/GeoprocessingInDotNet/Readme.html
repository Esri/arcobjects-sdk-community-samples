### Usage
#### Data preparation  
1. Create a directory on your local machine to copy the test data and files. For example, create gp under the C:\ drive in which case your files and data will be in C:\gp\AirportsAndGolf directory. You can, however, create the folder anywhere as the program prompts you to type the path in the command line.  
1. Copy the AirportsAndGolf folder from the <ArcGIS Developer Kit installation location>\Samples\data folder to the directory you created in Step 1. The following files show in the file viewâ€”golf.gdb (geodatabase), airportgolf.mxd (map document), Find Golf Courses.tbx (toolbox), and validateinput.py (Python file). See the following screen shot that shows the data and files on the local drive and in the Catalog tree:   

#### Test the .NET solution  
1. Open the solution file in the CSharp or VBNet folder for this sample.   
1. Compile and run the solution.   
1. On the console window, type the data's full path, then press Enter.
