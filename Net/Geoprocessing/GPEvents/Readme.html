In many cases, you need to listen to the GP events as they happen, for example, when a toolbox is loaded, or messages received while a tool is executing.</div>

The TestListner application serves as the client that listens to the GP events. </div>

### Usage
1. Start Visual Studio and open the solution.  
1. Build the solution to make the GeoprocessorEventHelper class .dll and the TestListner test application.  
1. Right-click the project and select Set as Startup Project to ensure the TestListner project is the start-up project for the solution (notice the messages on the Output window in Visual Studio as they get fired by the geoprocessor). The application creates a random shapefile in the machine's temporary directory.
