## ViperPin tool

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This sample is a custom edit tool that creates parcel PIN values for parcel features. It is a new version of the SnakePin sample provided with ArcGIS 9.3.1 and earlier. The tool creates PIN values based on the intersection of an edit sketch and an underlying parcel layer. A base PIN value and an increment value can be added. This task works with any polygon data that has a numeric field to accept the PIN value. However, due to the numerous ways organizations represent parcel PINs, it is difficult to produce a generic tool that works for all; therefore, this tool serves as a sample only.</div>
