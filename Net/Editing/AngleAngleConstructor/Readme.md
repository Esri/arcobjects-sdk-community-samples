## Angle Angle shape constructor

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This sample demonstrates how to create a shape constructor. The angle-angle shape constructor adds points to the edit sketch based on the input of two point locations and two angles. An angle intersection is constructed based on these inputs. If a new point is not calculated, a message dialog box appears indicating this. </div>
