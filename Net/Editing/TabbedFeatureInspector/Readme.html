  ## Tabbed feature inspector

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:my="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/infopath/2003/myXSD/2006-02-10T23:25:53">This sample demonstrates how to create a custom object inspector. Custom object inspectors allow you to control the information that's returned to the user when selected features are inspected. The custom inspector calculates and reports the area and perimeter for the selected polygons, length, and coordinates for selected lines and points. It also reports the total number of selected features. </div>

The first panel of the control shows the standard information for the feature. A command button is also created for the extension classid value to be added to the feature class so it can recognize the extension.</div>
