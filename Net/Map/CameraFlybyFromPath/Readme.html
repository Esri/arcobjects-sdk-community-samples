  ## Create camera flyby from path

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:my="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/infopath/2003/myXSD/2006-02-10T23:25:53">This add-in sample describes how to create a camera fly from path. The tool mimics the out-of-the-box functionality to create a camera fly from path available on the Animations toolbar. The tool creates a Globe Camera animation that moves the camera along a selected feature in a feature class.</div>

You can choose to create a simple flyby where both the observer and target move along the path. The second option allows you to create a camera fly where the observer moves along the path while looking at the current target. The third option allows you to move the target along the path while the observer remains fixed at one location. </div>
