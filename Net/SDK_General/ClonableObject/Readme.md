## Clonable object

  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:my="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/infopath/2003/myXSD/2006-02-10T23:25:53">This sample demonstrates a clonable object that implements the IClone interface. This sample supplements the "Implement cloning" topic (refer to the "See Also" link at the bottom of this sample). This sample creates an instance of a user-defined clonable object that has managed and unmanaged class members, then the test application clones the object, and reports the values of class members from original and cloned objects in a console window.</div>
