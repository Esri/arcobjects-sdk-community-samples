## Create a raster catalog using the geoprocessor

This sample uses the geoprocessor class in conjunction with CreateRasterCatalog and WorkspaceToRasterCatalog geoprocessing tool classes to create a raster catalog, and load a directory of rasters to the raster catalog. It demonstrates the recommended approach for creating and loading raster catalogs from rasters in a folder.
