    ACTIVE TEMPLATE LIBRARY : CustomSolver Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this CustomSolver project for you to use as the starting point for
writing your Dynamic Link Library (DLL).

This project is implemented with Visual C++ attributes.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your project.

CustomSolver.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

_CustomSolver.idl
    This file will be generated by the compiler when the project is built. It will contain the IDL 
    definitions of the type library, the interfaces and co-classes defined in your project.
    This file will be processed by the MIDL compiler to generate:
        C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations (_CustomSolver.h)
        GUID definitions                                (_CustomSolver_i.c)
        A type library                                  (_CustomSolver.tlb)
        Marshaling code                                 (_CustomSolver_p.c and dlldata.c)

CustomSolver.cpp
    This file contains the object map and the implementation of your DLL's exports.

CustomSolver.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.

CustomSolver.def
    This module-definition file provides the linker with information about the exports
    required by your DLL. It contains exports for:
        DllGetClassObject  
        DllCanUnloadNow    
        GetProxyDllInfo    
        DllRegisterServer	
        DllUnregisterServer

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named CustomSolver.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file that defines resource IDs.
